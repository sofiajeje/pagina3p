    <li style="background-color: rgba(233, 61, 176, 0.815);">RULE #1: TREAT OTHERS THE
        WAY YOU WISH TO BE TREATED
        The good old Golden Rule says it all:
        empathy, tolerance and peace. This
        principle teaches you to love yourself
        and love others. It spans cultures and
        faiths and is a universal age old
        concept which can’t fail!</li>
    <li style="background-color: rgba(96, 38, 231, 0.815);">RULE #2: LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY,
        NOT TO SPEAK
        Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the real will to listen to
        others. Only then will you be able to understand each other and
        build bridges. Change cannot happen and peace cannot be
        established if people are unable to communicate with others; to
        listen to their experiences and views and show empathy,
        understanding and compassion.</li>
    <li style="background-color: rgba(58, 236, 73, 0.815);">RULE #3: ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
        We all have different opinions and we may not all
        agree on the same things. Building compromise and
        mutual understanding is incredibly important.Sometimes we simply need to agree to disagree and
        recognise that there are different beliefs and forms of
        expression other than our own.</li>
     <li style="background-color: blue;">RULE #4: DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH
        VIOLENCE 
        Violence is never the answer. Peace can only be
        brought through free will, dialogue, empathy and forgiveness. Do not stoop to same level as someone
        who is violent and therefore continue the vicious
        cycle. This does not change anything.</li>
    <li style="background-color: darkgoldenrod;">RULE #5: ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID 
        Any one person can have multiple aspects to their identity. Identity
        comprises many elements such as nationality, cultural-linguistic
        origin, age and religious beliefs. Identity can and does change,
        taking on many new forms and means of personal expression as we
        learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs, marry into a
        different tradition and experience life! Do not put people into a box.
        Avoid categorising people according to and us vs.
        them narrative and remember: we are all singular individuals with
        unique experiences. Such approaches and narratives are highly
        divisive and unproductive.</li>
    <li style="background-color: darkred;">RULE #6: AVOID STEREOTYPES 
        Take people for the individuals they
        are. Avoid misconceptions,
        stereotypes and toxic narratives and
        get to know a person instead. This
        will avoid offence,
        misunderstandings and ultimately
        help you to create a real bond with
        others based on true understanding,
        empathy and trust. After all, no one
        likes to be judged – especially from
        the outside</li> <br>

     <li style="background-color: darkmagenta;">Present perfect: I have treated my family the way they want to be treated.</li> <br>
